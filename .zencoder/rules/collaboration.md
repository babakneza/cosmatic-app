# Collaboration Rules for BuyJan Project

These rules must be strictly followed when working on the BuyJan e-commerce application:

## 1. No Fake Data
- Do not implement or suggest using fake/mock data as fallbacks when the API doesn't work
- The application should show proper error states or empty states rather than displaying fake data or images
- All data must come from the actual API endpoints

## 2. No Unauthorized Changes
- Do not modify any existing code sections without explicitly asking for permission first
- Any changes to components or functionality that have already been designed and coded will only be made after receiving approval
- Respect the existing architecture and design patterns

## 3. Backend and API Key Changes Require Permission
- Do not make any changes to backend configurations, API keys, or authentication methods without explicit permission
- All such changes must be proposed first with clear explanations of why they might be needed
- Authentication mechanisms should not be modified without approval

## 4. Consult on Fundamental Decisions
- Consult before making any fundamental architectural or design decisions
- Do not rely solely on judgment for important changes but present options and seek input
- Provide clear explanations of the implications of different approaches

These rules are mandatory and must be followed for all work on the BuyJan project.
