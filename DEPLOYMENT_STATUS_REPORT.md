## üîç Known Issues & Notes

### Pre-Existing TypeScript Errors
- Many TypeScript errors exist in codebase (pre-existing)
- These do NOT prevent production build
- Next.js build will succeed despite type-check errors
- Recommended to fix in future refactoring sprint

### API Route Compatibility
- Some API routes may need updates for Next.js 15
- Ensure dynamic parameters are properly handled
- Test all API endpoints before going live

### Recommendation for Immediate Post-Deployment
Focus on monitoring:
1. Error logs (first 24 hours)
2. Performance metrics
3. Checkout success rate
4. User authentication issues
5. API response times
