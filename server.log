Creating turbopack project { dir: 'C:\\projects\\cosmatic_app_directus', testMode: true }
Error: Turbopack build failed with 1 errors:
./src/app
Error: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
    We couldn't find the Next.js package (next/package.json) from the project directory: C:\projects\cosmatic_app_directus\src\app
     To fix this, set turbopack.root in your Next.js config, or ensure the Next.js package is resolvable from this directory.
    Note: For security and performance reasons, files outside of the project directory will not be compiled.
    See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.
